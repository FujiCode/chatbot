              Software engineers will use engineering principles
              and various programming 
              languages to build software applications.

              In most cases, software engineers will use 
              data structures and algorithms to design and build their programs
              for better optizimation, or in other words, making sure the program
              is running fast with less resources used.

             According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics,
             software engineers earn approximately $50 per hour (average).

             However, the amount you earn from being a software
             engineer can vary vastly with experience, and skill set.

             According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics,
             careers in software engineering/development 
             are expected to grow 22% over the next ten years which is faster 
             than the average rate of all jobs within that same time period.
